    			<h3 style='font-size:125%; text-align:center;'><b>Bowl Game Winner Classification</b></h3>
    			<h3 style='font-size:100%; text-align:left;'>	THINK ABOUT TRYING TO EMBED A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK HERE, TO SHOW SCREENSHOTS, RUN PLOTS, SHOW MODEL OUTPUT, ETC. The smorgasbord of bowl games that mark the end of the college football season are notoriously unpredictable (at least the good ones). Each year in the College Football Playoff era, we hear complaints from fan bases who just missed the cut, and many from others in favor of expanding to an eight team playoff. This dissatisfaction is the foundation of a difficult classification problem: the Committee has a difficult time determining who the best four teams in any given year are, since there is no perfect way to decide which team would beat any other on a given day. To make matters worse, in recent years there have been embarrassments -- I'm looking at you, Notre Dame and Ohio State -- that have shown just how inaccurate the Committee's evaluation of team quality can be.  PUT IN SOME BOX SCORES. There are a number of reasons for why predicting who would win a given college football game in a bowl situation might be interesting. For one, there is the aforementioned issue of being able to accurately determine who the best four teams are, to guarantee the most competitive Playoff. There are also obvious betting applications to this type of project, since a good model might be able to exploit an edge over the Vegas oddsmakers. All other reasons aside, though, there are a number of issues that make this problem not only tricky to solve, but also interesting in an intellectual sense, and to satisfy my curiousity as a college football (Michigan, unfortunately) fan.</h3>
