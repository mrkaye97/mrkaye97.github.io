- **6/11/20 - NPR Up First Podcast:** "Joe Biden has substantial leads in a wave of new polls, and many of them are ten point leads. And as to the 'What about 2016?' response that I can already hear listeners saying into my ears, here's the big difference: Joe Biden is over 50% in a lot of those polls, and that is a mark that Hillary Clinton very rarely got to, that makes the lead a lot more durable."
  The "What about 2016" critique being referenced is the fact that many news outlets (Huffington Post, NY Times, etc.) gave Clinton greater than a 95% chance of winning the election (FiveThirtyEight gave her around a 65-70% chance, at best). Obviously, she ended up losing, sparking outrage towards and confusion over those seemingly overly-optimistic projections. As of today, June 11th, 2020, [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698) gives Biden _roughly_ a 55% chance of winning.
