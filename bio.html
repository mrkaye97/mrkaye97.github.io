				    <h2>Past</h2>
				    <p>I grew up in New York City and Wayne, Pennsylvania, and went high school at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, CT. I graduated from Carleton College at the end of 2019 with a degree in mathematics and economics, but focused mainly on statistics and computer science.</p>

				    <h2>Present</h2>
				    <p>I just got home from an amazing semester in Stockholm, and am excited to relax -- ski, catch up on reading, and cook, especially -- before prepping for and taking the GRE, and starting a new chapter in my life in March. I'll also be working on a few data science projects and cleaning up this website some more at the same time, so stay tuned.</p>

				    <h2>Future</h2>
				    <p>I'm academically interested in economics and public policy, statistics, and data science. I especially love the intersection of statistics and baseball, which is the route that I hope to take to begin my career. In the longer term, I'm considering graduate school in statistics, data science, or computer science to shore up my skills and give me a broader foundation to apply to my work.</p>
