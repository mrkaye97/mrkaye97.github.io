				    <h2>Have Been</h2>
				    <p>I grew up in New York City and Wayne, Pennsylvania, and went high school at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, CT. I graduated from Carleton College at the end of 2019 with a degree in mathematics and economics, but focused mainly on statistics and computer science.</p>

				    <h2>Am Now</h2>
				    <p>I just finished a long-term vacation, spending a lot of time skiing, cooking, and reading. I moved to Baltimore at the start of March to start the next chapter in my life: Doing analytics work in the Orioles front office. This has been a lifelong dream of mine, and it feels unbelievable to have this opportunity.</p>

				    <h2>Am Going</h2>
				    <p>I'm academically interested in economics and public policy, statistics, and data science. Currently, I'm working on data science and baseball projects. In the longer term, I'm considering graduate school in statistics or computer science to shore up my skills and give me a broader foundation to apply to my work.</p>
