				    <h2>test Where I've Been</h2>
				    <p>I grew up in New York City and Pennsylvania, and went high school at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, CT. I've spent my last three years at Carleton College in Northfield, MN majoring in economics and math but broadly studying computer science and statistics, as well.</p>

				    <h2>Where I Am</h2>
				    <p>I spent the summer of 2019 as an intern with the FRED team in the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This fall (2019), I will be studying abroad in Stockholm at the Stockholm School of Economics, and graduating two trimesters early afterwards.</p>

				  <div class="column" style="background-color:Ivory;">
				    <h2>Where I'm Going</h2>
				    <p>I'm interested in economics and economic research, public policy, and data science. In the near term, I'm looking for jobs in these fields to gain some exposure in the next few years. In the longer term, I will likely pursue at least a Master's (and maybe a Ph.D) in computer science, data science, economics, statistics, or something in between.</p>
