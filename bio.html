				    <h2>Have Been</h2>
				    <p>I went high school at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, CT and graduated in 2016. I then graduated from Carleton College at the end of 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics, focused mainly on statistics and computer science. Major highlights included serving as a Prefect (RA) for Choate underclassmen during my senior year and studying abroad in both A Coru√±a, Spain and Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

				    <h2>Am Now</h2>
				    <p>I just finished a long-term vacation, spending a lot of time skiing, cooking, and reading. I moved to Baltimore at the start of March to start the next chapter in my life doing analytics work in the Orioles front office, and this is where I've spent the past few months. In the meantime, I've been casually working on some side projects and less casually training for a half marathon in October.</p>

				  <div class="column" style="background-color:#FF4D4D30;">
				    <h2>Am Going</h2>
				    <p>I'm academically interested in algorithms and other theoretical computer science, economics and public policy, and (Bayesian) statistics. I work on data science projects, and am passionate about data visualization, causal inference, and interpretable machine learning. I'm working on improving my knowledge on all of those. In the longer term, I'm considering graduate school in statistics or computer science to shore up my skills and give me a broader foundation to apply to my work.</p>
