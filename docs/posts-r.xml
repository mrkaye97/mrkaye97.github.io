<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://matthewrkaye.com/posts/series/doing-data-science/2023-04-03-unit-testing/unit-testing.html">my last post</a> on unit testing analytics code, I started off by saying that I had never heard of unit testing until my second data science job. Not in college, not in internships, and not in my first data science job. The same is true for pull requests and code review – they were completely new to me.</p>
<p>This, in my view, is a very unfortunate commonality in analytics teams. All too often, code will go unreviewed or kept out of any kind of version control system entirely. Ultimately, this practice, albeit common, is detrimental to the teams practicing it.</p>
<p>Since then, code review – both doing code review for others and getting feedback from others on my code – has grown to become one of my favorite parts of my job. It’s also a mission-critical process for any team that strives to maintain a high-quality codebase. But more importantly, it’s an valuable social exercise, and an fun way for contributors to come together as a team to collaborate, learn from each other, and improve their skills.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-first-git">But First: Git</h2>
<p>There are a ton of introductions to Git online, all of which are far better than anything I could write here. If you’re not already at least somewhat familiar with Git, I’d recommend starting with a post like one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git">From GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control">From Atlassian</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F">From Git itself</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, what I’ll discuss here doesn’t require any particular Git knowledge.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-code-review" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-code-review">On Code Review</h2>
<p>I wasn’t sure where to start this post. I considered discussing Git itself, but I decided it would be better to leave it to the experts. Then I thought about discussing the function of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a>, but that didn’t seem particularly valuable either. So I figured I might just jump into the meat of it: Why code review is valuable, and why analytics teams should be doing more of it than they are.</p>
<section id="why-do-we-review-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-do-we-review-code">Why Do We Review Code?</h3>
<p>People and teams have wildly differing opinions about what the main objective of code review is. The following is the opinion of the Tidyverse team:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The primary purpose of code review is to ensure that the overall “code health” of our packages is improving over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another common opinion on the main purpose of code review is to catch bugs in code before they hit production.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these are both important objectives of code review to be sure, but are not the <em>main</em> objective. My team’s view is that the main objective of code review is knowledge transfer between teammates. On our team – with “team” encompassing both data and engineering – we talk often about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> of our work. A toned-down explanation of the bus factor is that it represents the number of people who need to go on vacation, or be out sick, or leave for a new job for a project to come to a grinding halt because else nobody on the team knows how a particular system works. We’ve been bitten multiple times by projects with a bus factor of one, meaning that if one person were to leave, that project would be left in limbo.</p>
<p>Analytics work is no different than engineering work in this respect: If one data scientist lives in a dark room for two years building a novel model and ships it to production without anyone else knowing how it works, how to maintain it, and how to monitor it, then that project is risky. If that data scientist were to leave, there would be a model in production that nobody else had experience working with, which could result in any number of issues. In steps code review to help us solve this problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-reasons-to-review-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-reasons-to-review-code">Other Reasons To Review Code</h3>
<p>Aside from knowledge transfer, code review is also a valuable opportunity to do quality control. In no particular order, all of the following (and more) can be suggested in code review:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bug fixes</li>
<li>Maintainability improvements, such as improving the readability of the code, adding comments, adding tests, etc.</li>
<li>Performance improvements</li>
<li>Security improvements</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these are important aspects of maintaining a codebase over the long-term, and, in my experience, are far too often overlooked by analytics teams. In particular, a past team of mine – as well as many others, from what I’ve read and heard in talking to others in analytical roles – had a bad habit of data scientists being siloed and not having any eyes on their work until things were “ready” to be shipped to production. In my opinion, data products are software and should be treated as such. This means that if our models will be shipped to production, then it’s imperative that the code underlying them is written in a way that’s understandable by others, safe, correct, and, to whatever extent necessary, performant. Code review helps achieve all of these goals.</p>
<p>Lastly, code review is a social exercise. It’s a great way for a team to work together, especially in the world of remote work. In getting feedback from teammates, data scientists get to flex their collaboration muscle and, ideally, this type of collaboration allows the whole to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<section id="an-example-review" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example-review">An Example Review</h3>
<p>Since code review is unfamiliar to a lot of us in the analytics world, I’ll give an example of how I might do a review. Our team often works with data from external sources like the Census for doing all kinds of analysis. Let’s imagine reviewing the following code that a hypothetical teammate has put in to determine the five counties in Arizona with the highest percentage of Native American residents:</p>

<p>At first glance, this code looks pretty involved and poorly written to me. In the real world, we often write complicated code that relies on hyper-specific domain knowledge about the problem being solved in order to really understand it. As I mentioned above, our team often finds ourselves working with external data sources, such as the Census data shown here. And these sources usually have their own internal codes or identifiers that denote what the data you’re actually looking at is about. For instance, the series <code>B01001C_001E</code> used above represents the total Native American population in a region. In the Census, it’s corresponding “concept” is defined as the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>B01001C_001E: SEX BY AGE (AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE ALONE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, these codes are not comprehensible for the layman. There’s method to the madness, but we so often work with gibberish codes that don’t correspond to anything intuitive and make code review and maintenance dramatically harder. The challenge here is that in order to effectively review this code, the reviewer not only needs to review what the code is trying to accomplish in some high-level sense, but also needs to understand the data itself and its schema in order to understand how the author is trying to accomplish their goal. Unfortunately, the code’s author has not done a good job of helping the reviewer (me) understand the code.</p>
<p>Not only do I not have any context on the Census codes, but there’s no documentation linked (or written out) to help me find what the codes mean, there’s no documentation of the API response to explain why they’re seemingly removing the first item in the response’s body and setting it as the names of the columns in my final data frame, and there’s no explanation of what <code>na_pct</code> means, which in the context of this work means “percentage Native American” but could also reasonably mean something like “percentage of the data that’s <code>null</code>”.</p>
<p>And this is exactly where the value of code review comes in. We often like to say that you’re not writing code for yourself right now. Instead, you should be writing it for a future you in six months or a year who won’t remember all of the intricacies of this problem anymore. In short, you want your code to be understandable to future you, and, by extension, your teammates. But code authors, just like anyone else working on a project of any sort, are often so deep in the weeds of their work and so familiar with all of the ins and outs that it’s easy to forget just how confusing their work can be at times. Code review is a great opportunity for others to ask for clarification, which is the knowledge transfer I mentioned before.</p>
<p>If a teammate put in these changes, I’d request a few improvements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What do the Census codes mean?</li>
<li>What does <code>na_pct</code> mean?</li>
<li>What does the response from the Census API look like?</li>
<li>What does <code>state:04</code> mean?</li>
</ol>
<p>After requesting clarification on all of those points, I’d hope the code would ultimately end up looking something like this:</p>

<p>Now that the code has been rewritten, future readers of the code have some much needed context. The author has explained what the data looks like when we get it back from the API, has explained what each of the codes corresponds to, and has renamed a variable to be more helpful. Ultimately, these changes will make it easier for readers to understand what this code is trying to accomplish and work with it.</p>

<p>The key takeaway here should be that in doing this review, we’ve established some shared sense of how this code works between <em>multiple</em> people instead of just one (the author) understanding it. In addition, the reviewer helped the author rework their code to make it easier for anyone else on the team to understand. This means that when we need to use this code in the future, it’ll be written in a way that makes it easier for that future person to work with, which will ultimately lead to them being able to ship more quickly and confidently, and needing to reinvent the wheel less often.</p>
<p>A popular saying is that code is read ten times more than it’s written since we often need to understand existing code to author new code. Reviews are a great way to make sure that code is written in a maintainable, understandable way so that when it’s read all of those many times in the future, it’s able to be understood effortlessly.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Unit testing was a concept I had never even heard of before I started my <em>second</em> data science job. It never came up in any of my college statistics or computer science courses. It never came up in any of my data science internships. It never came up in my first data science job.</p>
<p>In conversations I have with friends – and, broadly, conversations with basically anyone doing data science or analytics – I face lots of pushback when it comes to unit testing. Usually the objections come in the form of either not knowing <em>why</em> you might test, since the code is just so simple and straightforward that nothing could go wrong, or not understanding the value added. In my opinion, both of these objections come from the same place. At first glance, it seems like some combination of blissful ignorance about what could go wrong and overconfidence in one’s own ability or in their code’s correctness, but I think that the objections actually come from something deeper. In my opinion, it’s the unfamiliarity of testing. It’s not something that’s commonly taught to people involved in analytics, and so it feels new. That can be scary.</p>

<section id="whats-a-unit-test" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-a-unit-test">What’s A Unit Test?</h2>
<p>First thing’s first: What’s a unit test? It’s actually really simple! Unit testing tests the smallest possible components of your code for correctness and what I would define as “good behavior.” In analytics, you might test things like feature engineering steps, metric definitions, or data wrangling code. The basic idea of a unit test is that you take a function you’ve written, and you’d make up some inputs to the function and then check if your code produces the outputs you’d expect. In the simplest case, you might test the identity function as follows:</p>

<p>All we’re doing here is checking that for some given input, our function returns the expected (correct) output. You can also test that your function returns an error or warning, returns nothing, returns <em>some</em> output, and much more. I’d highly recommend looking at the documentation for <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/">pytest</a> to get a sense for what and how to test.</p>

<section id="case-study-feature-engineering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-feature-engineering">Case Study: Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>Data scientists very often write feature engineering code. And as it turns out, feature engineering is a very common place where bugs can pop up unbeknownst to the code’s author.</p>
<div class="callout-important callout callout-style-simple no-icon">

<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>It’s important to note that data scientists are usually writing Python or R, which are both dynamically typed, interpreted languages. Unit testing is doubly valuable in these types of languages, since you don’t get the benefits of a compiler and static type checks to catch issues in your code. In languages like Python and R, anything can go wrong in your code. And you often won’t find out about issues until runtime, or, depending on the nature of the bug, even later (if ever).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-example">An Example</h3>
<p>Let’s write some example code to create a simple feature to use in a hypothetical machine learning model downstream.</p>
<div class="cell" data-layout-align="center" data-hash="unit-testing_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_c0b2015731146ce93b02b161739792e3">

<span id="cb3-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This might look familiar: It’s a function that takes a variable <code>x</code> and standardizes it. Now I’ll generate some data to show how it works.</p>
<div class="cell" data-layout-align="center" data-hash="unit-testing_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_9ac936cca1e25eb9019ac68762ca5b1d">

</div>
<p>We can plot a histogram of our data to show what it looks like:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s run <code>raw</code> through our feature engineering function.</p>
<div class="cell" data-layout-align="center" data-hash="unit-testing_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_f4f67fc856df93ccf70f288974bb0b99">

<span id="cb6-2"></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">hist</span>(std, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">breaks =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">20</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! Now <code>std</code>, the new variable that we created from standardizing <code>raw</code>, looks like it follows a standard normal distribution.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trivial-examples-unexpected-results">Trivial Examples, Unexpected Results</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve written a function to create a feature, let’s use that feature engineering step on a couple of real-world examples. Keep in mind that as data scientists, we’re often working with messy data – it could include missing values, outliers, data of an incorrect type, etc. and there are often very few guarantees about what our data will look like in practice. These next few examples show how things could go wrong (often very quietly) in our seemingly correct feature engineering step we wrote above.</p>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] NA NA NA NA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you’re familiar with R, this should be expected. And you’re probably thinking to yourself that we just need to set <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>, and you’d be right! But this brings me to the first major point I’d like to make on how things can go wrong.</p>
<div class="callout-important callout callout-style-simple no-icon">
<div class="callout-body d-flex">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>When you’re writing your code, it’s easy to forget things like adding <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> when the data you’re working with doesn’t appear to need it. It’s probably not your default behavior to remember to always set the flag to tell R to remove <code>NA</code> values, since if you’re not working with any of them, why would you remember to do that? Expecting yourself to <em>remember</em> to do something like this is a recipe for very brittle, error-prone code.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zero-standard-deviation">Zero Standard Deviation</h4>
<p>How about another non-trivial bug: A standard deviation of zero. Consider a toy example: Predicting whether or not someone plays basketball.</p>
<p>In this example, let’s say we have both men and women in our training data, and we want to use the height of each person to predict whether that person plays basketball. It probably doesn’t make sense to standardize the heights without grouping, since we don’t want to end up with a distribution of heights where most of the women are below average and most of the men are above average. It’d be much smarter to standardize <em>within group</em>, which would then produce a measure of height relative to the “competition” in some sense. Let’s give that a shot on a trivial data set where every man is the same height.</p>

<p>So what happened here? In the male group, all of the heights were the same. This resulted in a standard deviation of zero when we went to standardize our height variable, which meant dividing by zero. So we get <code>NaN</code> back – Not a Number.</p>
<p>This example feels trivial, but in practice it’s not. If your data had hundreds or thousands of groups, it’s not all that unlikely to have a situation like this. And note that R doesn’t throw any kind of warning or error, it just quietly returns you <code>NaN</code> when you’re expecting a real number.</p>

<p>R doesn’t yell at you for dividing by zero unlike Python for instance, or virtually any other self-respecting programming language. This means that if you accidentally divide by zero somewhere in your data pipeline, you could very well end up with a bunch of <code>NaN</code> if you standardize. And working with real-world data means that dividing by zero happens fairly often, generally because of small issues in the data we’re working with.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons">Lessons</h3>
<p>What have we learned here?</p>
<p>In short, there are many ways for things to quietly go wrong in your data pipelines, especially in a language like R. Even with a function as simple as standardization, it’s easy to cook up all kinds of possible corner cases or other issues that would cause your function to return any number of unpredictable results. And when working with real-world data, some of these quirks are inevitable. It’s virtually impossible that you’d never run into any of the issues enumerated above when working with messy data for any amount of time. And these examples were about as simple as they could be. In the real world, analytical code is often far more complicated and data far messier than this, which compounds the likelihood of issues like these.</p>

<section id="enter-testing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enter-testing">Enter Testing</h2>
<p>And with all of that: Back to testing. Testing is the only way to know that your code is actually doing what you think it’s doing, and writing tests is a great way to make guarantees about the ability of your code to handle some of these issues that we’ve discussed. Writing tests also lets you ensure that your implementation is correct, and it lets you refactor your code more easily by loudly alerting you if you’ve broken something, which should make you much more confident in the correctness of your implementation.</p>

<p>And with that, let’s write some tests. Imagine that we knew that we wanted to write our feature engineering function to do standardization. We also know that we want to avoid some of the bugs that we introduced in the examples above. One possible option for handling those cases where our function will do something unexpected would be to throw an error if we get unexpected inputs. That’s what I’ll illustrate here – it’d let the user learn about the issue quickly and debug. There are many options for how to handle these issues though. You might also fall back on a default value when your code will return a <code>NA</code> or <code>NaN</code>, for instance. Now, on to the tests.</p>

<p>Awesome! We just did a simple refactor and our tests passed, so I feel good about the correctness of that refactor. This was a very simple example, but you could imagine arbitrarily complex refactors. The value of a test suite increases exponentially as the complexity of the code increases.</p>
</section>
<section id="wrapping-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>There are a few important takeaways from this post.</p>
<p>First and most importantly, it’s important to test your code. There are so many ways that things can go wrong, and writing tests is the only way to really be confident that nothing is. This is especially true in dynamically typed, interpreted languages like R or Python, where data scientists don’t get the benefits of a compiler or a static type system to catch bugs in their code.</p>
<p>Second, analytical code that’s well-written should be easy to test. Ultimately, lots of the code we write for analytics work takes some data, does something to it, and returns some new data. That type of logic makes for a great use case for unit testing: If your code doesn’t produce the values you expect, it’s incorrect.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are many tools in Python (<code>pytest</code>, <code>unittest</code>, etc.) and R (<code>testthat</code>) to make unit testing as simple as writing a few lines of logic and an assertion or two. And then you get all the benefits of having well-tested code, such as the newly-found ease of refactoring said code without being concerned about breaking it.</p>
<p>Happy testing, and enjoy the peace of mind!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>By definition, library code is code that’s written to being reused by programs other than itself that are unrelated to each other. For instance, <code>dplyr</code> (R) and <code>pandas</code> (Python) are common examples of library code: Instead of writing code from scratch to work with tabular data, you might use one of those two fantastic libraries. And you get some additional benefits from using them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Those libraries are well-documented, so it’s easy to figure out how to use them.</li>
<li>They’re well-tested, so you (presumably) know that bugs are less likely than if you were to try to write the same functionality from scratch.</li>
<li>They’re (relatively) performant.</li>
<li>They’re widely used, so it’s easy to find answers to questions and get help from the communities using them.</li>
</ol>

<section id="a-common-library" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-common-library">A Common Library</h2>
<p>At CollegeVine, we have <code>collegeviner</code>: An R package containing a lot of code that we use very often for all kinds of analytics projects. Some things that live in <code>collegeviner</code> include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Plot theming code, so that we can consistently theme graphics across all of our work.</li>
<li>A custom implementation of item-based collaborative filtering, which is core to our school recommendation system.</li>
<li><code>DBI</code> and <code>aws.s3</code> wrappers for connecting to and querying our databases and working with data in S3.</li>
<li>Helper methods for common math we do, such as converting between odds, log-odds, and probabilities.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous helper code for things that don’t exist natively in R, such as <code>yeet</code> for removing an item from a list and <code>%notin%</code>, the inverse of the <code>%in%</code> operator.</li>
<li>An implementation of the Brier Skill Score, which is a metric we often use for evaluating classification models.</li>
<li>A lot more!</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think of <code>collegeviner</code> as being a common library of things that our team does often, so we don’t need to repeat ourselves or reinvent the wheel.</p>

The first thing you might want to do is have some logic to help your team connect to your data warehouse. For this example, let’s just imagine that “warehouse” is your local Postgres instance. Then, you might write a method for your library called <code>connect_to_dwh</code> like this:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="versioning">Versioning</h4>
<p>Lastly, it’s important to <em>version</em> your code. <a href="https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200">Semantic Versioning</a> (SemVer) is a very common standard for versioning library code. In R specifically, you can read about versioning in <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/lifecycle.html">Chapter 22 of <em>R Packages</em></a>.</p>
<p>In our toy example, this means that if you change how the logic of your <code>connect_to_dwh</code> function works, you should change the version of your package so that your users (your teammates) don’t get blindsided by your change. Incrementing your package’s version shows your teammates that something has changed in your library, and they can update their code to rely on the latest version (if they wish), or continue using the current version they’re on, or anything else.</p>

<p>Note that being able to control which version of a library your code is using requires some manner of managing dependencies. In R, I would highly recommend <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">renv</a>. In Python, I like <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>.</p>

<section id="one-library-per-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-library-per-model">One Library Per Model</h2>
<p>In addition to a common library for sharing code that’s very often used across the data org, our team has also gotten into the habit of having a library per ML model in production. This definition can be a bit flexible (both in terms of what “ML model” means, and also what “production” means), but the basic principle should be the same: ML in production requires at least some training logic and some monitoring logic. It’s a good idea to share code between those two things. Let’s consider another simple example.</p>
<section id="iris-species-prediction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iris-species-prediction">Iris Species Prediction</h3>
<p>Let’s imagine that we work for a florist. On our website, we have a service where someone can provide some measurements about an iris (either a setosa or a virginica), as we’ll tell them which of the two we think it is. We know we’ll want to retrain the model periodically as we get more data, and we’ll also want to monitor how our model performs out-of-sample. Both training the model and monitoring will require some shared logic: loading raw data, doing feature engineering, and making predictions. So it would make sense to have those two jobs rely on a single library, as opposed to needing to repeat the logic. Let’s write that library here.</p>
<section id="fetching-the-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fetching-the-data">Fetching the Data</h4>
<p>First, let’s write a method to fetch the raw data from our data warehouse. In practice, it probably makes sense to factor out the SQL here into individual SQL scripts, but for this example I’ll just include the SQL directly as a string.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that all of the methods above can and should be unit tested in the same way we tested our helper for connecting to the database. Testing is a great way to ensure the correctness of your code and make it more maintainable by making it easier to refactor in the future, and putting all of your modeling logic into a library like this makes it very easy to test. For instance, here’s how you might write a couple of unit tests for the petal width feature.</p>

<p>And that’s it – you have a simple retraining job. This is a very minimal example, but this general framework is very flexible and modular, and it makes up the foundation for how we write our retraining jobs at CollegeVine. You can plug and play all different kinds of feature engineering logic, logic to fetch raw data, metrics, etc. We also use <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLFlow</a> for versioning models and tracking experiments, so our retraining jobs have lots of logging of artifacts, parameters, and metrics to our MLFlow instance.</p>

<p>Next, let’s imagine we want to monitor out-of-sample performance of the model. Let’s modify the table with our raw data in the database for this, just for the sake of an example.</p>

<p>Great, and now let’s make one or two small modifications to our code from above that pulled the raw data from the data warehouse.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb20" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1">fetch_raw_data <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(conn, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">created_after =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</span>) {</span>

<span id="cb20-6"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">      SELECT *</span></span>
<span id="cb20-7"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">      FROM blog.iris</span></span>
<span id="cb20-8"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">      WHERE </span></span>
<span id="cb20-9"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">        species IN ('setosa', 'virginica')</span></span>
<span id="cb20-10"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">        AND created_at &gt; '%s'</span></span>
<span id="cb20-11"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">      "</span>,</span>
<span id="cb20-12">      created_after</span>
<span id="cb20-13">    )</span>
<span id="cb20-14">  )</span>
<span id="cb20-15">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>All we’ve done here is added the ability to specify a <code>created_at</code> date to use as the cutoff point, where we’d only include records in our raw data that were created after said point. In practice, this lets us filter our raw data down to only records that were created after the model was trained (the out-of-sample data).</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb21" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><span class="do" style="color: #5E5E5E;
font-style: italic;">## In practice, this would be set at training time and "frozen"</span></span>
<span id="cb21-2"><span class="do" style="color: #5E5E5E;
font-style: italic;">## possibly by logging the value as a parameter in the MLFlow run</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3">model_trained_at <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">median</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">fetch_raw_data</span>(conn)<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>created_at)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now that we’ve artificially created a <code>trained_at</code> date for the model, we can run our monitoring job. It’s quite simple, and very similar to the retraining job. All we do here is pull raw data that has been created since the model was trained, run the feature engineering pipeline, make predictions, and compute the accuracy of the model out-of-sample.</p>

<p>The key piece to notice is how much we’re leveraging our library code in both the retraining and monitoring job. In both cases, we’re doing some very similar things – pulling raw data, creating features, making predictions, computing accuracy – so it makes a lot of sense that we’d want to reuse the code for those two jobs.</p>
<p>There might also be more use cases for the code: More retraining or monitoring jobs, REST APIs, ETL jobs, etc. The more times you need to rely on the same logic, the more benefit you’ll derive from having a single source of truth for all of the logic for your modeling process.</p>
<p>It also might be useful to separate this library from the common library proposed at the start. There are important tradeoffs to consider: On one hand, a single library might be convenient for having all of your logic in a single place. But on the other hand, as your library grows in scope, it’ll necessarily have a bigger footprint, rely on more dependencies, etc. which will make its use and maintenance more difficult. A happy middle ground for us has been having a single library per “model” or use case. For instance, at CollegeVine we have a package called <code>mlchancing</code> for our <a href="https://www.collegevine.com/admissions-calculator">chancing model</a> and a separate package called <code>schoolrecommendr</code> for school recommendations and affinity scoring. Keeping these separate has made it easier to iterate on each model individually while also not being a maintenance or ramp-up headache.</p>
<p>It’s my view that models and other analytics work that is in production is software, and should be treated as such. If a model is going to be shipped to production, it at the <em>very least</em> needs to be tested, documented, versioned, and put through some kind of CI/CD process. It’d be even better if it’s monitored automatically so that the data scientists working on it can be notified quickly if things start going wrong. Ultimately, writing library code for your modeling work is very well-suited to meeting all of these expectations. And it also just makes everyone’s lives easier by not needing to reinvent the wheel all the time.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://matthewrkaye.com/posts/2023-03-20-metrics-calibration/calibration.html">my last post</a> I wrote about common classifications metrics and, especially, calibration.</p>
<p>With calibration in mind, this post will show why balancing your classes – which is an all-too-common practice when working on classification problems – is generally a bad idea and leads to poorly calibrated models.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this example, I’ll use the Wisconsin breast cancer data. The data is built into the <code>mlbench</code> package in R and <code>scikit-learn</code> in python. You can also get it from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll only be using <code>cl_thickness</code>, which is the indicator for clump thickness.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-fitting">Model Fitting</h2>
<p>With that class imbalance in mind, let’s get to model fitting. The first thing I’ll do is fit a simple logistic regression model to predict the class (either malignant or benign) from the clump thickness.</p>
<p>First, I’ve written a bit of <code>tidymodels</code> helper code below for reuse later.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll fit a simple logistic regression model by specifying <code>logistic_reg()</code> as the model specification in <code>fit_model()</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>And now we can make a calibration plot of our predictions. Remember, the goal is to have the points on the plot lie roughly along the line <code>y = x</code>. Lying below the line means that our predictions are too high, and above the line means our predictions are too low.</p>

<p>Awesome! Even with the class imbalance, our model’s probability predictions are well-calibrated. In other words, when we predict that there’s a 25% chance that a tumor is malignant, it’s actually malignant about 25% of the time.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>All of a sudden, our model is very poorly calibrated. We’re consistently overpredicting the probability of a tumor being malignant. Why is that? Think back to what we just did: We removed a bunch of examples of benign tumors from our training data.</p>
<p>Let’s think about that from first principles for a minute. If you had no information at all, a reasonable guess for whether or not a tumor is malignant would be the overall proportion of tumors that are malignant. In the unbalanced data, that number was about 34%. But after balancing, it’s now 50%. That means that we’ve just biased our “no-information” prediction upwards by about 16 percentage points (or 50%). And so it shouldn’t be surprising that in our calibration plot above, we see that we’re consistently over-predicting. Our probabilities are too high because the baseline rate at which the true class appears in our training data has just increased significantly.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An important note which I’ll circle back to later is that this intuition about a baseline guess is directly rated to the intercept term of the logistic regression model you fit.</p>

<p>“But no!” you might be thinking. “Why would you just undersample directly? You’re supposed to use an algorithm like SMOTE to overcome your class imbalance problem.”</p>
<p>Great! Let’s see if using SMOTE fixes our calibration issues. I’ll first use SMOTE to intelligently oversample the minority class.</p>

<p>Now that we have balanced classes thanks to SMOTE, let’s fit another logistic regresion model and see if it’s any better-calibrated.</p>

<p>Interesting – same problem. With SMOTE, we still make very similar errors to the ones we made in the case where we naively undersampled from our majority class. But let’s think back to first principles again, because the exact same rationale applies. When we undersampled, we ended up artificially increasing the baseline rate of malignant tumors in our training data, which resulted in predictions that were too high. With SMOTE, we’re doing the exact same thing: We’ve stil rebalanced our data to 50/50, we’ve just done it a fancier way. So of course we’ll have the same problem with overprediction.</p>

<p>“But no!” you might be thinking. “You need to use a more complicated model like a random forest, because logistic regression won’t pick up on complexities in your data well enough to be well-calibrated.”</p>

<p>Same issue again, albeit not quite as severe. And the same logic holds. In fact, it’s even more straightforward with tree-based models. In a decision tree, you would determine a predicted probability by seeing what proportion of the labels in the leaf node that you end up in based on the features belong to the positive class. But then there’s the same logic as before: We’ve just artifically increased the number of instances of the positive class dramatically, so of course the proportion of labels belonging to the positive class in our leaf nodes will increase.</p>

<p>In all three models, the coefficient associated with the clump thickness is very similar. This should make sense intuitively: Our sampling was at random, so the relationship between the clump thickness and whether or not the tumor was malignant shouldn’t change at all.</p>
<p>The thing that does change, though, is the intercept term. In both the model where we undersampled from the majority class and in the SMOTE model, the intercept term is significantly higher than it is in the original model on the unbalanced data. This should feel similar intuitively to the idea of the baseline guess from before. As its core, the intercept term in your logistic regression model is the guess you’d make with “no” information (in this particular case, no information means a clump thickness of 0).</p>
<p>We can illustrate this more clearly with three intercept-only models:</p>

<p>And it’s just as we expected: The intercept coefficient in the SMOTE model and the undersampling model are exactly 1/2, which corresponds to the fact that we balanced the classes to be exactly 50/50. And the intercept in the original model with the unbalanced classes is exactly the percentage of the data made up by the true class (malignant).</p>
</section>
<section id="when-to-rebalance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-to-rebalance">When To Rebalance</h2>
<p>There are some times where re-balancing the classes in your training data might make sense. One application that comes to mind is if you have strong prior information that your training data is actually biased, and is over-representing one of the two classes.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s imagine we have data from 1000 breast cancer patients and we know a priori that about 20% of tumors are malignant, but in the training data, maybe 40% of the tumors we have are malignant. Depending on the long-term goal of the project, it might make sense to undersample from the malignant cases to get the overall rate of tumors being malignant down to around the 20% prior.</p>
<p>The rationale behind doing this would be that if you wanted your model to generalize well to future cases (outside of your training set) and you knew that in the broader population about 20% of cases are malignant, your biased training data could very well result in biased predictions out-of-sample even if your predictions look good in-sample.</p>
<p>Another case where rebalancing can make sense is if you plan to use a technique like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platt_scaling">Platt Scaling</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotonic_regression#:~:text=In%20statistics%20and%20numerical%20analysis,to%20the%20observations%20as%20possible.">Isotonic Regression</a> to re-calibrate your predictions ex-post. These methods are a bit beyond the scope of this post, but they’re both fantastic ways to make sure a model is giving well-calibrated predictions while using classifiers that don’t guarantee calibration, such as tree-based models. For instance, a combination of upsampling with SMOTE, using an often poorly-calibrated classifier like a tree booster such as XGBoost, and then re-calibrating ex-post with a Platt Scaler can result in a rare win-win scenario: Well-calibrated predictions, but also improved performance on normal classification metrics like the F1 score or AUC.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://matthewrkaye.com/posts/2023-03-20-metrics-calibration/calibration.html">previous post</a>, I wrote about calibration. In short, I think calibration is the single most important metric in evaluating the performance of classification models.</p>
<p>And so with that in mind, the main takeaway of this post is that you should be <em>very</em> careful about trying to “fix” the “problem” of class imbalances when you’re working on classification problems. If I could summarize the principle that I would follow in just a sentence, it would be that class imbalances often reflect important information about the prevalence of your classes in the real world, and it’s often risky to dismiss that information in the name of having data that’s split equally. In other words, class imbalances are usually not a problem at all. They’re a feature, not a bug.</p>

  <title>Interpreting AUC-ROC</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Kaye</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.matthewrkaye.com/posts/2023-03-09-on-auc-roc/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><strong>AUC</strong> goes by many names: AUC, AUC-ROC, ROC-AUC, the area under the curve, and so on. It’s an extremely important metric for evaluating machine learning models and it’s an uber-popular data science interview question. It’s also, at least in my experience, the single most commonly misunderstood metric in data science.</p>
<p>I’ve heard several common misunderstandings or flat-out falsehoods from people in all kinds of roles discussing AUC. The biggest offenses tend to come from overcomplicating the topic. It’s easy to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">Wikipedia page for the ROC curve</a> and be confused, intimidated, or some combination of the two. ROC builds off of other fundamental data science concepts – the true and false positives rates of a classifier – so it’s certainly not a good place to <em>start</em> learning about metrics for evaluating the performance of models.</p>
<p>The most common cause for confusion about AUC seems to come from the plot of the <em>ROC</em> curve, and nothing particularly special about AUC itself. Generally, I’ll hear AUC explained as being the area under the ROC curve, and that it’s all about testing how well your model balances false positives and false negatives. That’s all well and good, but it doesn’t give someone new to AUC any intuition about what AUC <em>actually</em> means in practice. For instance, let’s imagine we’re trying to predict the chance that a student is accepted at Carleton College – a quite common problem at CollegeVine! How does saying “AUC tells me about how my model is balancing false negatives and false positives” tell me anything about how well my model is doing at predicting that student’s chances?</p>
<p>The main issue I have with this factual-yet-unhelpful explanation of AUC is just that: While it may be true, it doesn’t get to the point. And even worse, it’s sometimes used as a crutch: A fallback answer when someone feels stuck when asked how to interpret AUC in real, practical terms.</p>
<p>So in this post, I’ll focus on just one thing, then: Answering the question above about how to interpret AUC.</p>
<section id="what-is-auc" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-auc">What is AUC?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, it’s usually not helpful to try to explain AUC to someone by telling them that it’s just the area under the ROC curve, or that it’s a metric you can use for predicting <em>probabilities</em> as opposed to predicting <em>classes</em>, or that it’s a metric trying to balance false positives and false negatives. None of those things get to the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> AUC, then? It’s pretty simple: Let’s imagine a model <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> being evaluated on data <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> contains some instances of the true class and some instances of the false class. The AUC of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M"> on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is the probability that given a random item from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> belonging to the <em>true</em> class (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T">) and another random item from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> belonging to the <em>false</em> class (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F">), that the model predicts that the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> being true (belonging to the true class) is higher than the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F"> being true (belonging to the true class).</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the example about Carleton admissions, and let’s imagine that we have a model that gives a probability of admission to Carleton given some information about a student. If I give the model one random <em>accepted</em> student and one random <em>rejected</em> student, the AUC of the model is the probability that the accepted student had a higher chance of acceptance (as estimated by the model) than the rejected student did.</p>
<p>For more on this, I’d refer everyone to <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc">this fantastic blog post</a> by the team at Google, which does a great job at explaining further and/or better.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-simple-implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-implementation">A Simple Implementation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to convey this idea might be to show a simple implementation of AUC. Below is some R code.</p>
<p>First, let’s start by writing a function to do exactly what’s described above. Again, here’s the algorithm given some evaluation data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose a random item from the <code>true</code> class.</li>
<li>Choose a random item from the <code>false</code> class.</li>
<li>Make a prediction on each of the two items.</li>
<li>If the predicted probability for the actually true item is greater than the predicted probability for the actually false item, return true. Otherwise, return false. If they’re equal, flip a coin.</li>
<li>Repeat 1-4 many times, and calculate the proportion of the time your model guessed correctly. This is your AUC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s write this in R with a little help from some vectorization.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen here, AUC actually shouldn’t be all that much of a cause for confusion! The way I like to frame it is this: The AUC of your model is how good your model is at making even-odds bets. If I give your model two options and ask it to pick which one it thinks is more likely, a “better” model (by AUC standards) will be better at identifying the true class more often.</p>
<p>In real terms, that’s a meaningful, good thing. If we’re trying to predict the probability of a cancer patient having cancer, it’s important that our model can distinguish between people with cancer and people without it when given one person from each class. If it couldn’t - meaning the model was either randomly guessing or doing worse than random - the AUC would be 50% (or below 50%, in the worse-than-random disaster scenario).</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-thoughts">Additional Thoughts</h2>
<p>I also often hear the misconception that AUC is sensitive to things like class imbalance. This means that if the true class makes up a disproportionately large (or small) proportion of the evaluation data, that can skew the AUC. But based on the intuition we just built before, that’s of course not true. The key thing to remember is that the model is given one true and one false example. In choosing those, it doesn’t matter if the true class only makes up 0.005% of all of the examples in the evaluation data: AUC is only evaluating the model on its ability to determine <em>which</em> of the two is the true class.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing related to class imbalance, and just sample size in general, that <em>would</em> affect AUC, which is the raw number of examples of each class in the evaluation data. If, for instance, you had only a single instance of the <code>true</code> class in the evaluation set, then the AUC of the model is entirely determined by how good the predictions of the model are on that single example. For instance, if we have a single <code>true</code> class and the model predicts a 100% probability of it being true, then, assuming the predictions for all of the other examples in the evaluation set are <em>not</em> 100%, the AUC of the model as evaluated on that data is 100%. This isn’t necessarily because the model is “good” in any sense, but just because the model is over-indexing to a single good prediction in the evaluation set. In practice though, this AUC estimate wouldn’t generalize. As we got more data, the predictions for all the true classes would certainly not all be 100%, so the AUC of the model would go down over time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s an easy fix for this problem. AUCs are a point estimate, but we could also estimate a margin of error or a confidence interval for our AUC. For a situation where we only have a single instance of the true class in the evaluation set, the margin of error for our AUC would be very wide.</p>

<section id="wrapping-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Hopefully this post helped give a better intuition for what AUC actually is! A couple of major takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>AUC doesn’t need to be this super complicated thing about trading off between false positives and negatives and trying many different classification thresholds and such. In my opinion, it’s much simpler to just think about it as the likelihood of a guess that your model makes between two choices being correct.</li>
<li>AUC isn’t affected by class imbalances.</li>
</ol>

<p>This bit of code makes a nicely formatted plot of the times you went to sleep and woke up over the past three months. You can also use <code>fitbitr</code> to expand the time window with a little help from <code>purrr</code> (the Fitbit API rate limits you, so you can’t request data for infinitely long windows in a single request).</p>

<p>And that’s it! Hopefully this helped show how <code>fitbitr</code> makes pulling your data easy, and gets you curious about the insights you can glean from your own data. The Fitbit API gives you access to so much interesting information about yourself, your habits, your fitness, and so much more, and <code>fitbitr</code> is just meant to be a door into that gold mine.</p>

<p><code>rstudio::global</code>, this year’s iteration of the annual RStudio conference, was a few weeks ago. Here were some highlights:</p>
<section id="talks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="talks">Talks</h2>
<p>There were a few talks I really loved:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/using-r-to-up-your-experimentation-game/">Using R to Up Your Experimentation Game</a>, by Shirbi Ish-Shalom. On experimentation, sequential testing, taking big swings, and being statistically rigorous</li>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/maintaining-the-house-the-tidyverse-built/">Maintaining the House the Tidyverse Built</a>, by Hadley Wickham. On building and maintaining the Tidyverse, and what package maintenance in the real world is like when you have millions of downloads.</li>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/organization-how-to-make-internal-r-packages-part-of-your-team/">oRganization: How to Make Internal R Packages Part of Your Team</a>, by Emily Riederer. On how using internal packages (like <code>collegeviner</code> at CollegeVine!) can improve your R workflow and make teamwork in R dramatically easier, smoother, and more efficient.</li>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/fairness-and-data-science-failures-factors-and-futures/">Fairness and Data Science: Failures, Factors, and Futures</a>, by Grant Fleming. On model fairness, bias, and evaluation techniques, and why they’re important to get right.</li>
</ul>

<section id="cool-new-things" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cool-new-things">Cool New Things</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>finetune</code>, Max Kuhn’s new <code>tune</code>-adjacent package, is live (albeit a little buggy)! It has some cool new model tuning algorithms, including racing methods with <code>tune_race_anova()</code> and <code>tune_race_win_loss()</code>, in addition to my personal favorite: <code>tune_sim_anneal()</code> for Simulated Annealing! <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/whats-new-in-tidymodels/">Link to the talk</a></li>
<li>Major improvements to <code>shiny</code>, including some serious caching upgrades that’ll improve performance dramatically! <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/making-shiny-apps-faster-with-caching/">Link to the talk</a></li>
</ul>

  <title>What’s New in slackr 2.1.0</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Kaye</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.matthewrkaye.com/posts/2021-02-07-what-s-new-in-slackr-2-1-0/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><code>slackr 2.1.0+</code> is live! There are a whole bunch of exciting changes that we (mostly <a href="https://github.com/andrie">Andrie de Vries</a> and I) have made to improve the package a bunch.</p>
</section>
<section id="changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>Here are some of the things that are new in <code>slackr 2.1.0+</code>. For more info on the package, check out the <a href="https://github.com/mrkaye97/slackr">Github repo</a> and the <a href="https://mrkaye97.github.io/slackr/index.html">pkgdown site</a>.</p>
<section id="ease-of-use-improvements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ease-of-use-improvements">Ease of Use Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve dramatically improved error messaging, so long gone are the days of errors like <code>No 'id' column found in 'x'</code>! Now, error messages should be far more helpful, with some hints about what might be going wrong.</li>
<li>We’ve updated the package documentation significantly, so now there’s a far more informative <a href="https://github.com/mrkaye97/slackr">README</a>, some vignettes, and a <a href="https://mrkaye97.github.io/slackr/index.html">pkgdown site</a>.</li>
<li>We’ve more clearly described the different use cases for <code>slackr</code>, in order to better help users set up <code>slackr</code> in a way that makes sense for them.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="new-features" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve fixed a bunch of bugs that were preventing things like <code>icon_emoji</code> and <code>username</code> from working, so those are fixed now!</li>
<li>We’ve brought back some old functions that were removed in <code>slackr 2.0.0</code>: <code>slackr_history()</code> and <code>slackr_delete()</code>. See the docs for descriptions of what these functions can do.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="back-end-changes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-end-changes">Back-End Changes</h3>
<p>We’ve made a ton of changes for how <code>slackr</code> interacts with the Slack API:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now allow paging, which is especially helpful when you have a workspace of more than 1000 channels.</li>
<li>We cache requests to get lists of channels and users so that we don’t need to repeat common API calls. This speeds up calls to <code>slackr_***()</code> and limits how often you need to actually hit the API.</li>
<li>We’ve gotten rid of a really nasty implementation of channel caching (writing a local cache to the disk) in favor of the method described above.</li>
<li>We’ve factored out API calls into a separate function, which makes the package easier to understand and test.</li>
<li>Speaking of testing, we’ve implemented a whole bunch of unit tests, and will be working on more.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="deprecations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deprecations">Deprecations</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve deprecated a bunch of camel case functions in favor of their snake case counterparts for simplicity. Don’t worry! These are soft-deprecated for now. They won’t go away fully until a future version of <code>slackr</code></li>
<li>We’ve deprecated <code>text_slackr</code> in favor of <code>slackr_msg</code>, since they do basically the same thing.</li>
</ul>
