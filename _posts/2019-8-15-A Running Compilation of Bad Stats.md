This is a rolling compilation of good and bad stats and quotes heard on TV broadcasts or otherwise, mainly having to do with sports and politics. Decisions about which are good and which are bad are left to the reader. Kindly excuse any slight misquotes, and enjoy!

All-time Stat: Oakland Athletics outfielder Khris Davis hit .247 for four years in a row.

8/13/19 - MLB Network: <i>Discussing Gleyber Torres's immense success against Orioles pitching: </i>"If it were up to Gleyber Torres, the Yankees would play the Orioles every day of the week and twice on Sunday."

7/15/19 - MLB Network: <i>The night before, the Rays had a team no-hitter broken up by a single through the shift in the 9th inning. The hit went to where the second baseman would normally be positioned.</i> A misquote, but the general gist: "The craziest part about this single was that its hit probability was only 16%." 

7/12/19 - MLB Network: Only one team in the Majors has not intentionally walked anyone during the 2019 season. Houston.

7/9/19 - MLB Network: "Gleyber Torres is only the third ever Yankee to make two All Star games before the age of 23. The other two are Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio."
