I'm now finishing up my third week in Stockholm -- time flies. Week 1 was mostly orientation: learning a little bit of Swedish, meeting the other group members, starting to find our way around the city, etc. We trekked out to Sandhamn, an island in the Archipelago, for the first weekend. Really beautiful spot. Weeks 2 and 3 were the start of classes -- 3 program classes and 1 SSE class. Overall, so far, so good.

A few of the biggest highlights so far:
<ul>
  <li>Meeting my host family. They're great! Very welcoming and we've been getting along super well.</li>
  <li>Dinner parties. One of the biggest perks of living with a host family is getting opportunities to meet some Swedes. I got to go to 3(!) dinner parties in the first two weeks of being here. The biggest takeaway: families here are just like families at home.</li>
  <li>Getting to see some of Stockholm, especially Gamla Stan (the old town). The city itself is amazing. Tons of great architecture and food, it's clean and easy to get around, and there's lots to do.</li>
  <li>SATS. The Swedish Program gets us a (~$100 / month in value) membership to SATS, a Scandinavian gym chain. It's like the Equinox of Stockholm.</li>
</ul>

Some things I've learned so far:
<ul>
  <li>The Swedish attitude towards work is VERY different from the American attitude.</li>
  <li>Same for their attitude towards the government.</li>
  <li>Classes at SSE work a little differently than at Carleton (obviously). My SSE economics course (International Economics with Prof. Paul Segerstrom) is a 300-kid lecture. Maybe only half of the students show up, and the only assessment is a final exam. The material seems fine -- it's a first course in trade. More interesting, though, is the number of editorial (and controversial, in my view) comments that he makes about a variety of topics during the lecture.</li>
</ul>

Now, the days are starting to get a little darker as we chug along towards the start of winter. So it goes.
