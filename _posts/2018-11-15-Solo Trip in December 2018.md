I'm going to Europe in a few weeks! I'm flying into Vienna, and then am heading to Prague, Olomouc, Krakow, and Budapest. I'll be staying in hostels all along the way, and could not be more excited. This is my first real solo trip (something I've been wanting to do for a while), so it should be a great experience.

People always ask why I would go somewhere solo.
