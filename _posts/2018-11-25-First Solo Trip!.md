I'm going to Europe in a few weeks! I'm flying into Vienna, and then am heading to Prague, Olomouc, Krakow, and Budapest. I'll be staying in hostels all along the way, and could not be more excited. This is my first real solo trip (something I've been wanting to do for a while), so it should be a great experience.

People always ask why I would go somewhere solo. It's a fair question, especially since most people aren't used to seeing sights, eating, and generally being alone. They associate solo travel with being lonely. I get it -- It seems like I'll be going to Europe for three weeks with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. This seems like a little bit of a misconception. Sure, I'll techincally be travelling alone, but I'll have plenty of people staying in the hostels with me to hang out with. Not only that, but going places solo has its own benefits. I went to Toronto alone on my drive out to Minnesota for school this year, and when I was there I found that being able to wake up, eat, and go where I want, when I want can be very liberating: no waiting around for other people or making compromises on how to spend the days. I loved being able to spend my days in Toronto like that.

In any case, we'll see how it goes. Hopefully this is the first of many trips like this for me.
