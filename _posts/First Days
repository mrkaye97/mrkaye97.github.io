It's 5:43AM in Vienna, and I'm writing this because I can't sleep. Jet lag.So far, so good on my trip. The flight here went surprisingly well -- I actually got some sleep on the flight to Zurich which was unexpected and much appreciated. Flying in and out of ZRH was awesome. The views of the alps and snow-dusted cities and towns from the air is unbelievable. Then, true to Swiss form, ZRH was a very efficient airport, and was beautiful and clean. Also, we didn't fill out immigration cards on the flight in to Zurich from JFK, which was a little weird.

Anyeays, I made it to Vienna in one piece, and Wombat's Naschmarkt is a very nice hostel (although its absolutely huge). My roommates are nice and everything is clean and comfortable.

Last night, after getting all of my stuff set up, I roamed around the city a while. There was a line at a stand selling brats so I got one of those, and then explored some of the Christmas markets. The ones at Karlsplatz and especially Stephansplatz were massive and very busy. We wound up going back to Karlsplatz later last night for some beer, killed wine, and an open-faced sandwich with what looked like raw bacon on it. I was a little nervous eating that at first, and I had never had killed wije, but it was all good. 

Side note: I've been taking a lot of photos but don't know how to embed them into these HTML posts from my phone, but will post some when I get home.
