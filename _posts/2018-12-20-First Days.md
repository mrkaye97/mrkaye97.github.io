It's 5:43AM in Vienna, and I can't sleep. Jet lag. So far, so good on my trip. The flight here went surprisingly well -- I woke up and was about an hour from landing in Zurich, which was unexpected and much appreciated. Flying in and out of ZRH was just about all I could ask for in a connection. The views of the Alps and snow-dusted cities and towns from the air are unbelievable. ZRH lived up to its (Swiss) reputation: clean, well-organized, easy to navigate, and overall very efficient. One weird thing about the flight in, though: we didn't fill out immigration cards on the flight in to Zurich from JFK. Maybe that is normal in Switzerland? 

Anyways, I made it to Vienna in one piece, and Wombats' Naschmarkt is a very nice hostel (although it's absolutely huge). My roommates are friendly and everything is clean and comfortable.

Last night, after getting all of my stuff set up, I roamed around the city a while. There was a line at a stand selling w√ºrstl, so I got one of those and explored some of the Christmas markets. The ones at Karlsplatz and especially Stephansplatz were massive and very busy. Two of my roommates and I wound up going back to Karlsplatz later last night for some beer, mulled wine, and an open-faced sandwich with what looked like raw bacon on it. All went well -- mulled wine is what I imagine the kings and queens of old drinking, and where more appropriate to try it for the first time than an outdoor Christmas market in the old capital of the Austrian Empire?

Side note: I've been taking a lot of photos but don't know how to embed them into these HTML posts from my phone, but will post some when I get home.
