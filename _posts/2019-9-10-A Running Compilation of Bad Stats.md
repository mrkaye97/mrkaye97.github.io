This is a rolling compilation of good and bad stats and quotes heard on TV broadcasts or otherwise, mainly having to do with sports and politics. Decisions about which are good and which are bad are left to the reader. Kindly excuse any slight misquotes, and enjoy!

<b>All-time Stat:</b> Oakland Athletics outfielder Khris Davis hit .247 for four years in a row.

<b>9/10/19 - Stockholm School of Economics:</b> <i> Talking with an economics professor about the cause of wage growth in Sweden between 1860 and 1913 during significant migration of low-skill workers from Sweden to the U.S., which happened to overlap with a significant period of Swedish industrialization...</i> "This is exactly the point that I'm making. Swedish farmers - like my grandparents! - moved away to the U.S., and, as a result, wages went up in Sweden. This directly follows from the model, because we would expect the flow of migrants out of Sweden (low-wage, at the time) to the U.S. (high-wage, at the time) to cause wages to equalize somewhere in between the two. This is why we saw Swedish wages grow by 250% while U.S. wages only grew about 50% over the same period."

<b>8/13/19 - MLB Network:</b> <i>Discussing Gleyber Torres's immense success against Orioles pitching... </i>"If it were up to Gleyber Torres, the Yankees would play the Orioles every day of the week and twice on Sunday."

<b>7/15/19 - MLB Network:</b> <i>The night before, the Rays had a team no-hitter broken up by a single through the shift in the 9th inning. The hit went to where the second baseman would normally be positioned.</i> A misquote, but the general gist... "The craziest part about this single was that its hit probability was only 16%." 

<b>7/12/19 - MLB Network:</b> Only one team in the Majors has not intentionally walked anyone during the 2019 season. Houston.

<b>7/9/19 - MLB Network:</b> "Gleyber Torres is only the third ever Yankee to make two All Star games before the age of 23. The other two are Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio."

<b>Early 2019 - Effectively Wild Podcast, paraphrased:</b> Mike Trout has amassed about 65 WAR throughout his career, and is projected to have another 70 or so over the next ten seasons. Essentially, this means he has already had one Hall of Fame career, and is about to have another.

<b>Pre-2019 Season:</b> Only 10 players have ever had 5+ seasons of 9+ WAR. They are: Babe Ruth, Rogers Hornsby, Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez, Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig, Honus Wagner, Ted Williams, and Mike Trout.
